# PowerShell Automation — Project Overview

This project demonstrates how I use Windows PowerShell to automate basic IT tasks such as collecting system information, generating log files, and organizing output.

## Key Objectives
- Practice core PowerShell cmdlets
- Automate log collection in a repeatable way
- Organize output into a clean folder structure
- Show how scripting can save time for IT support tasks

## Why This Matters
Automation is a critical part of IT and cloud support.  
PowerShell scripts can simplify repetitive work, reduce human error, and provide consistent results that are easy to review and share.
