# Steps Taken — PowerShell Automation Project

1. Created a base folder structure for logs and scripts.
2. Opened PowerShell as Administrator.
3. Tested basic commands like `Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, and `systeminfo`.
4. Wrote a script (`collect-system-info.ps1`) to:
   - List running processes
   - List running services
   - Collect system information
   - Save the results into text files
5. Executed the script and verified that output files were created.
6. Reviewed the logs to confirm that the data was captured correctly.
